# 321 Movies

## Description
321 Movies is an all-encompassing simple web application that allows a user to search for official movie trailers, and gather relevant information such as cast members, year produced, iMDB rating, and a quick plot summary. 

This project was built to take the thinking out of movie night and to let our users get to viewing their favorite movies sooner.
